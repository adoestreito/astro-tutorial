    <p>
        I am working through Astro'ss introductory tutorial. This is the second
        page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!

        <ol>
            {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
        </ol>
        This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
        back and see how my journey is going!
    </p>
    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

        goal === 3 ? (
            <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p>
